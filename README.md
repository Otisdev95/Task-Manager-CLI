# Task Manager CLI Tool

<h3>
    Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹ In this project, i have built a simple Task Manager CLI (Command Line Interface) tool. This means i used commands to Create, View, Update, or Delete your todos.
</h3>

<p>
    I built this CLI tool using NodeJS. I have also used MongoDB as the database to store all my to-dos. Finally, i used a few helpful packages from npm:

<ul>
    <li><b>commander:</b> This helps us to build the CLI tool.</li>
    <li><b>chalk:</b> This makes messages in the terminal colorful and easy to read.</li>
    <li><b>inquirer:</b> This lets us ask the user for input.</li>
    <li><b>ora:</b> This makes the terminal show nice spinning animations.</li> 
</ul>
